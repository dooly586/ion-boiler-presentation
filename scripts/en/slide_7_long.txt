Finally, let me present our proposed objective validation testing approach.

We propose comprehensive comparative testing that fairly evaluates heat pumps, electric boilers, and our Ion Heating Boiler systems.

We have prepared two testing methodologies. First is real-world field testing in actual residential environments through pilot installations across selected UK households. Second is precision testing in standardized laboratory environments, reproducing various weather conditions.

We are confident that through such fair and objective comparative testing, we can clearly demonstrate the superiority of our Ion Heating Boiler.

This concludes our comprehensive presentation on New Energy's Ion Heating Boiler technology.

Now we'll move to our Q&A session and open discussion time for detailed technical information, UK market entry strategies, local partnership opportunities, and investment discussions.

Whether technical questions or business-related topics, please feel free to raise anything and we'll provide transparent and detailed answers. Thank you.
