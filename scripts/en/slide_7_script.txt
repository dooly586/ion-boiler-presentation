Finally, let me present our proposed objective validation testing approach.

We propose comprehensive comparative testing that fairly evaluates heat pumps, electric boilers, and our Ion Heating Boiler systems.

As shown on the screen, we have prepared two testing methodologies.

First is real-world field testing in actual residential environments. We propose pilot installations across selected households among the UK's 5,500 homes, directly comparing the performance and user response of all three technologies in real living conditions.

Second is precision testing in standardized laboratory environments. This involves reproducing various weather conditions from extreme cold to heat, cross-testing the three heating systems under identical residential conditions.

We are confident that through such fair and objective comparative testing, we can clearly demonstrate the superiority of our Ion Heating Boiler.

This concludes our comprehensive presentation on New Energy's Ion Heating Boiler technology.

Now we'll move to our Q&A session and open discussion time.

We can discuss in depth the more detailed technical information you may be curious about - specific mechanisms of ion generation, performance test results under extreme conditions, long-term durability data, installation and maintenance guidelines.

From a business perspective, we can explore concrete collaboration opportunities including UK market entry strategies, local partnership opportunities, pilot project participation, investment and technology licensing discussions.

Whether technical questions or business-related discussions, please feel free to raise any topics and we'll provide the most transparent and detailed answers possible. Thank you.
