Now let me explain the core technological principles and key advantages of our Ion Heating Boiler.

Our Ion Heating Boiler operates on a completely different proprietary principle from conventional indirect heating methods.

We apply alternating current directly to water, generating heat through the friction movement of ions present in the water. This is our 'molecular friction heat' principle.

Because water molecules and electrons move actively to generate thermal energy directly, there's virtually no loss during heat transfer processes. This is why our efficiency is exceptionally high.

As illustrated on the screen, you can see the specific principle of our technology diagrammatically represented.
