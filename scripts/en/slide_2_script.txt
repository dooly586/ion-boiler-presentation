Now let's examine real-world implementation cases.

Our Ion Heating Boiler has already been successfully deployed at major Korean enterprises, delivering outstanding results.

The most prominent success story is Hyundai Motor's Asan Plant. Through implementing our ion heating system, Hyundai Motor achieved annual energy cost savings of 1.05 million dollars. Additionally, they accomplished a remarkable reduction of 2,456 tons in CO2 emissions.

This achievement has been officially recognized in Hyundai Motor's 2025 Sustainability Management Report as an exemplary energy-saving case study.

Looking at specific figures, Hyundai's Asan Plant achieved 60% reduction in operating costs and 43% reduction in carbon emissions. Daesang Food Plant demonstrated 41% operating cost savings, while Novelis Korea achieved 46% cost reduction - consistently excellent results across all implementations.
