Good afternoon, everyone. I'm from New Energy Corporation.

Today, I'm excited to introduce our revolutionary next-generation carbon reduction heating solution - the Ion Heating Boiler.

As you can see on the screen, our Ion Heating Boiler achieves an remarkable 99.6% energy conversion efficiency. This represents a quantum leap beyond existing heating systems.

What makes this particularly significant is that our technology serves as an environmentally-friendly solution, dramatically reducing carbon emissions compared to conventional heating methods.

The Ion Heating Boiler isn't just another boiler. It's a completely new heating technology that generates heat by directly ionizing water molecules - a fundamental innovation in thermal engineering.
