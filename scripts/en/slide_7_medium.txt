Finally, let me present our proposed objective validation testing approach.

We propose comprehensive comparative testing that fairly evaluates heat pumps, electric boilers, and our Ion Heating Boiler.

First is real-world field testing in actual residential environments across selected UK households. Second is precision testing in standardized laboratory environments under various weather conditions.

This concludes our presentation on New Energy's Ion Heating Boiler technology.

Now we'll move to Q&A for detailed technical discussions, UK market entry strategies, local partnerships, and investment opportunities. Please feel free to raise any questions.
