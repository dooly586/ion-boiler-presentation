Good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to present New Energy's groundbreaking Ion Heating Boiler technology.

Today, I'll introduce you to our revolutionary next-generation carbon reduction heating solution - the Ion Heating Boiler system.

As you can see on the screen, our Ion Heating Boiler achieves an remarkable 99.6% energy conversion efficiency. This represents a quantum leap beyond traditional heating systems currently available in the market.

What's particularly noteworthy is that our technology serves as a truly green solution, capable of dramatically reducing carbon emissions compared to conventional heating methods.

The Ion Heating Boiler isn't just another boiler system. It's a completely new heating technology concept that generates heat by directly ionizing water molecules - a fundamental breakthrough in thermal engineering.
