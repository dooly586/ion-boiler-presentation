Now let me present the objective performance verification results of our Ion Heating Boiler.

The superiority of our product has been scientifically proven through official validation testing by the Korea Conformity Laboratories (KCL), a nationally recognized testing authority.

Test conditions were conducted under harsh environmental conditions ranging from -12.5°C to +5°C external temperature while maintaining 25°C indoor temperature. In comparison with Mitsubishi heat pumps, we achieved 28.1% power savings and 43% carbon reduction.

Additionally, our system demonstrated exceptional temperature precision of ±0.1°C and doubled the heating speed.

These are objective facts confirmed through official verification by a credible testing institution.
