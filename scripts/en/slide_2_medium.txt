Let's examine actual implementation cases.

Our most prominent success story is Hyundai Motor's Asan Plant. Through implementing our ion heating system, Hyundai Motor achieved annual energy cost savings of 1.05 million dollars and accomplished a remarkable reduction of 2,456 tons in CO2 emissions.

Daesang Food Plant demonstrated 41% operating cost reduction, while Novelis Korea achieved 46% cost savings - consistently excellent results.
