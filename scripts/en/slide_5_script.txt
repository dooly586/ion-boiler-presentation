Now let me explain in detail the core technological principles and key advantages of our Ion Heating Boiler.

First, let me explain the most important technological principle. Our Ion Heating Boiler operates on a completely different proprietary principle from conventional indirect heating methods.

We apply alternating current directly to water, generating heat through the friction movement of ions present in the water. This is our 'molecular friction heat' principle.

Because water molecules and electrons move actively to generate thermal energy directly, there's virtually no loss that occurs during heat transfer processes in conventional systems. This is why our efficiency is exceptionally high.

As illustrated on the left side of the screen, you can see the specific principle of our technology diagrammatically represented.

Key advantages include instant heat generation without thermal loss, precise temperature control, and environmental sustainability through reduced energy consumption. This breakthrough technology represents a fundamental shift in how we approach heating solutions.
