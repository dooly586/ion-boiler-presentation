Let me explain the core technological principles of our Ion Heating Boiler.

Our system operates on a completely different principle from conventional indirect heating methods. We apply alternating current directly to water, generating heat through ion friction movement.

Because water molecules generate thermal energy directly, there's virtually no heat transfer loss. This is why our efficiency is exceptionally high.
